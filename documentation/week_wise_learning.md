## Week 1: Data Extraction, Power BI Basics & Data Cleaning Concepts
### Overview

In the first week, the focus was on understanding how data is extracted, cleaned, and prepared for analysis. We were introduced to Power BI and learned why data quality is critical before performing any analysis or visualization.

Key Learnings

Learned how to extract data from different sources

Introduction to the Power BI interface and workflow

Understood that Power BI is a case-sensitive tool, which makes data standardisation very important

Data Cleaning Concepts (Power BI)

Text formatting techniques

Removing extra spaces

Standardising inconsistent text values

Splitting columns using a delimiter

Handling missing (null) values:

For non-numerical values, replace nulls with “Unknown”

For numerical values, replacing nulls using the average/mean

Removing null values where required

Power BI Concepts

Understanding Table View

Introduction to relationships between tables

Importance of clean and structured data for accurate dashboards

Outcome

This week built a strong foundation in data preparation, which is the most important step in the data analytics lifecycle.

## Week 2: Data Cleaning and Analysis Using Python
### Overview

The second week focused on using Python for data cleaning and analysis, especially for large datasets and scenarios involving live data.

Key Learnings

Why Python is used in data analytics:

Efficient handling of large datasets

Suitable for automation and live data scenarios

Code can be reused and re-executed

Introduction to Python libraries used for data analysis

Practical Exposure

Using Jupyter Notebook for data analysis

Performing data cleaning using Python

Handling missing values programmatically

Data manipulation and transformation using Python

Outcome

This week helped in understanding how automation and coding improve efficiency, scalability, and consistency in data cleaning and analysis.

## Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Overview

The third week focused on understanding data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is a crucial step before building dashboards or models.

Key Learnings

Understanding what EDA is and why it is important

EDA helps in:

Understanding the overall dataset

Identifying patterns and trends

Exploring relationships between variables

EDA Concepts Covered

Data values and volume

Distribution analysis

Matrix comparison

Relationship analysis between variables

Practical Application

Worked on the Netflix dataset

Framed five analytical questions

Performed analysis to answer those questions

Outcome

This week, improved my analytical thinking and the ability to extract meaningful insights by asking the right questions from data.

## Week 4: Live Data, APIs & GitHub Setup
###Overview

The fourth week introduced real-world data concepts, including live data, APIs, and professional project management using GitHub.

Key Learnings

Understanding live data and its importance

Difference between static data and live data

Introduction to APIs and how data connections are established

Overview of Web APIs and data integration

Understanding CRM systems

Learned about:

Synthetic data

Dummy data

Industry Exposure
